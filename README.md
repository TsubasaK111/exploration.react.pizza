# Guided Exploration Pizza App

This repo is for the guided exploration portion of the CC Immersive React lectures.

Please see the lecture recipes for a detailed plan on how to integrate this in a lecture:
- [React - Hello Components! Recipe](https://www.notion.so/codechrysalis/ReactJS-Hello-Components-0b21bc9930ad404daa7e588a6c7eb151)
- [React - Nesting and Architecture Recipe](https://www.notion.so/codechrysalis/ReactJS-Nesting-Architecture-3b3722766f99408bae5798d6a78e1008)

See branches that start with `step/#/....` for progression:
- `git checkout step/0/vanilla-pizza` - reference implementation in vanilla JS
- `git checkout step/0/create-react-app` - vanilla create-react-app scaffolding
- `git checkout step/1/hello-react-pizza` - static react component, but playing with event handlers
- `git checkout step/2/add-hooks` - dynamic pizza 🍕🍕🍕 with `useState`  and `useEffect`
- `git checkout step/3/componentize` - nested with props, etc.



*The below is vanilla scaffolding from the Create React App CLI:*

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
